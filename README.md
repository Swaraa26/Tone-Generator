Overview
This project implements a Tone Generator on the DE10-Lite FPGA development board using VHDL. 
It synthesizes musical notes corresponding to the Indian classical musical scale (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa1) by generating precise frequencies for each note. 
The system can also play melodies, such as the tune "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," by sequencing the generated notes with accurate timing.

Features
Generates eight distinct musical notes corresponding to the basic octave of the Indian classical scale.
Synthesizes tones by controlling the frequency using counters tied to the FPGA clock.
Implements melody sequencing using an array of note indices, enabling tune playback.
Supports two modes:
Single note generation mode (controlled by the input TONE).
Melody playback mode using predefined note sequences.
Runs on the DE10-Lite FPGA board, utilizing onboard clock and outputting audio through the designated output pin.

Components
CLK: Input clock signal.
RSTN: Active low reset input for system initialization.
TONE: Mode select input (controls single note or melody playback).
TONE_OUT: Output signal for audio tone generation.

Implementation Details
Each note's frequency is generated by toggling output signals at counts determined by the note frequency requirements.
A master counter sequences through the melody array to switch notes according to the tune.
Counters reset upon reaching their defined limits, ensuring stable frequency generation.
The melody "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" is hardcoded via the TWINKLE constant array.

Usage
Load the synthesized design onto the DE10-Lite FPGA.
Control the TONE input to switch between note generation and melody playback.
Output tone can be connected to a speaker or audio device for audible sound.

Technologies Used
VHDL for hardware description and logic design.
DE10-Lite FPGA as the hardware platform.
Standard IEEE libraries for VHDL coding.
